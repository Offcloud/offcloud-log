# A heartfelt message to our Offcloud family

Tuesday 9 December 2025, 20:13 PM GMT

Dear friends,

## We need to talk...

We've been letting you down, and it's been eating at us. The bugs, the slow support responses, the frustrations you've faced over these past months – we know. We see your messages, we feel your disappointment, and honestly, it hurts because we care deeply about each one of you who chose to trust us with your downloading needs.

**We're genuinely sorry.** Not in a corporate way, but in a very human, very real way.

## Why we've been so auiet

Here's the truth: we're a small team. Really small. While the big companies have hundreds of developers, we're just a handful of passionate people who believe in what we're doing. And for months now, we've been pouring our hearts and souls into something we believe will change everything.

We could have kept patching things up, applying band-aids to problems. But we didn't want to just fix things – we wanted to rebuild them properly, from the ground up. For you.

## Something very special is coming

In the next two weeks, we're releasing what we've been calling our "new engine" – though that doesn't really capture how special this upgrade truly is. 

We've completely reimagined BitTorrent handling. We've invested everything we had into CDN infrastructure. We've written proprietary code that we're genuinely proud of. This isn't just an update; it's a rebirth of Offcloud.

The difference will be night and day. We promise.

## An honest offer from us to you

Look, we know trust needs to be earned back. That's why we want to be completely transparent with you:

**Until December 19th**, we're offering something we've never done before:
- **Buy 1 month, get 3 months total** (yes, 2 months completely free)
- **Or get our annual plan for $28 instead of $69,99** (that's 60% off)

You'll find these offers in the Shop section of your account – no tricks, no special codes, just our way of saying thank you for sticking with us.

But here's the thing – and we want to be totally honest – if you're skeptical, **you can absolutely wait**. See the improvements at the end of December or even in January. Test the new engine. Feel the difference. We're confident you'll love it.

Just know that these prices won't be available afterwards. This is our one-time "thank you for your patience" gesture.

## Why your patience matters

Being a small team means every decision takes longer. Every line of code is written by someone who also answers support tickets. Every infrastructure upgrade is planned by the same person who fixes bugs. 

We're not making excuses – we're just being real with you. Your patience literally allows us to exist and improve. Without you believing in us, we couldn't do this.

## A personal promise

We're not just fixing technical problems. We're committing to being better in every way – including how we communicate with you and support you. You're not just users to us; you're the reason we wake up every morning determined to make Offcloud better.

The next few weeks will show you what we've been building. We genuinely believe you'll feel it was worth the wait.

## From Our Heart to Yours

Whether you take advantage of the discount now or wait to see the improvements first, thank you. Thank you for every frustrated email you sent instead of just leaving. Thank you for every time you gave us another chance. Thank you for being part of this journey.

We're about to show you what a small, dedicated team can achieve when they truly care.

See you on the other side of this upgrade.

With genuine gratitude and excitement,

**The Offcloud Team**

P.S. We're real people, not a corporation. When you write to support, you're writing to someone who probably coded part of the feature you're using. Remember that, and know that we're doing our absolute best for you.
